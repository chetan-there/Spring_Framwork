🚗 OrderService
public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService, DeliveryService deliveryService)


This means:

OrderService cannot exist without payment and delivery.

That’s why Spring forces you to give both via constructor.

Constructor injection = must-have items

Example:
Like a bike needs engine + wheels → without them, bike cannot be made.

💸 PaymentService

Here you have:

👉 Constructor injection
public PaymentService(@Qualifier("upiPayment") PaymentGateway paymentGateway)


Default payment is UPI.
Spring creates the PaymentService using this.

👉 Setter-style switching
public void switchPaymentMethod(int choice)


This is optional.
You can switch to Card if user selects Card.

Setter injection = changeable or optional items

Example:
Bike color can be changed later → it’s optional.

📦 DeliveryService

Delivery service only needs to print that a delivery agent is assigned.
No injection needed here.

🏁 MainApp

This takes user input:

1 → UPI
2 → Card


Then:

PaymentService switches payment method

OrderService places the order

DeliveryService assigns a delivery partner

Simple real-life workflow.

⭐ 3. WHEN TO USE CONSTRUCTOR vs SETTER INJECTION (VERY IMPORTANT)
✔ Use Constructor Injection When:

The dependency is mandatory

The object cannot work without it

Good for immutability (values cannot be changed later)

Examples in real life:

Phone needs a battery

Car needs an engine

In your code:
PaymentService & DeliveryService for OrderService.

✔ Use Setter Injection When:

The dependency is optional

OR it can be changed later

OR sometimes you don't have it at the time of object creation

Examples in real life:

Choosing UPI/Card/Cash at the time of payment

Adding a promo code (optional)

Selecting a discount coupon

In your code:
switchPaymentMethod(int choice) in PaymentService
setDiscountCode() in OrderService (if you add it later)

⭐ 4. WHY BOTH ARE USED IN ZOMATO PROJECT?
✔ PaymentService needs a default payment → Constructor Injection

Because order cannot start without at least one payment method.

✔ User may change payment method → Setter-like method

Because user chooses UPI/Card at runtime.

✔ OrderService MUST have:

PaymentService

DeliveryService
So → Constructor Injection
Order cannot be created without these.

⭐ Final Summary for You (16-year old level)
Injection Type	Meaning	When to Use	Example in Zomato
Constructor Injection	Must have	Object cannot exist without it	OrderService needs Payment & Delivery
Setter Injection	Optional / Changeable	Value may change later	Switch between UPI and Card
Method-based Switch	Runtime decisions	Based on user choice	Choosing payment method in console
