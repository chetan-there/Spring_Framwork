🚀 Factory Design Pattern – Zomato App Workflow (Summary)

Goal:
Automatically create the correct payment method object (UPI, Card, Wallet) without writing new code in OrderService every time.

Think of Zomato Payment Factory like a kitchen that prepares whatever dish you order.
You just tell the kitchen → “I want Pizza”
Kitchen → gives Pizza object.

Same:
User chooses → “UPI”
Factory → returns UPI Payment Gateway object

🔥 Factory Flow in Zomato App
1️ User chooses Payment Method in Console

Example:

Enter Payment Method (UPI/CARD/WALLET):

2️ OrderService sends request to PaymentFactory
paymentGateway = PaymentFactory.getPayment("UPI")

3️⃣ Factory checks the method
if (method == "UPI") → return new UpiPayment()
if (method == "CARD") → return new CardPayment()
if (method == "WALLET") → return new WalletPayment()

4️ Correct Payment Object is returned

OrderService now receives the correct implementation.

Example:

UPI payment selected

5️ OrderService uses that object
paymentGateway.pay(amount)

6️ Order continues

Payment successful

Delivery assigned

Discount applied

🧠 WHY FACTORY PATTERN IS USED?
Problem	Factory Solution
If new payment method comes (e.g., Crypto), you must modify many files.	Add one new class only and update the factory class.
Tight coupling	Loose coupling
Code becomes messy	Clean, maintainable
🧩 SUMMARY IN 5 LINES

✔ User chooses payment type
✔ OrderService calls PaymentFactory
✔ Factory returns correct payment class
✔ OrderService uses it without knowing details
✔ Easy to add new payment types in future
