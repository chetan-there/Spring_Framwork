✅ 1. Factory Pattern – Explanation 

Imagine you open Zomato and choose payment method:
“Pay by UPI / Pay by Card / Pay by Wallet”
Zomato must create the object of the correct payment class.

BUT…
Your main code should NOT decide which class to create.
Why?

Because:

❌ If–else everywhere = messy code
❌ Hard to add new payment types
✔ Better: Let a “Factory” create correct object for you

So we use:

⭐ Factory = Object–creating machine

Your app asks:

“Give me an object that matches the payment type”

Factory returns:

If user selects UPI → returns UpiPayment

If user selects CARD → returns CardPayment

If user selects WALLET → returns WalletPayment

Your main program does NOT know which class is being created.
This is the Factory Pattern.
